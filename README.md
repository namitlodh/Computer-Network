SMART SECURITY ALERT SYSTEM
With many cases of theft and robbery in the whole world, the number of robberies
reached 57,396 during 2011 including 65 armed robberies and those numbers are
increasing every year , so we decided to use Cisco Packet Tracer, to establish a high
smart security alert system for homes. Smart Security Alert System consists of
modules like Web Camera, Raspberry Pi, PIR Sensor, Alarm, Door Rules. The Web
Camera captures the images of any inactivity happening at home while the user is
not available at home. The PIR sensor detects any inactivity in the home and
instantly sends signals. Raspberry Pi then fetches the signal from webcams and PIR
sensors and sends captured images to Homeowners. Various conditions and
constraints are programmed based on the smart object connected to the home
gateway. Once any movement is detected, a loud alarm is produced to alert those
nearby of the unauthorized entry.
